# About
> "If there's one attribute that everyone could adopt from the skateboarding community, it would be to have a desire to learn something new- to try, and fall, and pick yourself up again- and repeat that process as many times as it takes to land the trick."

If you have ever seen anyone trying to learn a new trick on a skateboard, you will know of the labor and toil they exert in an effort to better understand 
the "physics" of what makes the trick happen, and what series of movements they need to execute in order to achieve it. It can take _months_ to learn a new 
trick. The only way to progress is to try, even if you fall for weeks on end until it clicks in your head and you begin to better understand the trick. 
This is the way *life* should be- trying new things. To stop learning is to stop progressing, and what is life without progression? Sure it's uncomfortable 
and you'll have to be a "beginner" at something new, but thats what life is all about. Embrace it!
